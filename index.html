    <h1>What is the Illuminati Society, anyway?</h1>
    <p> Well, that really depends on whom you ask. Some people maintain it’s a now-defunct clandestine organization that existed during the Enlightenment era and consisted of freethinkers who opposed prejudice, the Roman Catholic Church’s religious control and gender inequality.
        Today, most Illuminati enthusiasts (read: internet “experts”) agree it is a modern-day secret society with ancient roots that is made of up powerful and elite individuals who conspire to control the world — politics, government, religion, entertainment, the whole shebang. Their goal? A “New World Order.”</p>
